This is the scouting system for Team 1100.

First rev: blackscreen, but full functionality
Next rev: simple GUI
Goal: advanced GUI

If you want to work on this, please let me (Bianca) know in person or at koala\_bear@verizon.net.  You _must_ know Java.  Knowing AWT/Swing is preferable, but not necessary for the first part.

Feel free to ask me any questions!  I'd love to make the scouting system a team effort.
